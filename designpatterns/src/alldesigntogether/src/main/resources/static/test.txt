Ace High in Golden, I was tall and on the rocks
Ass a little touch of attitude
Whose that Madam X
Comin' in at 3 o'clock?
Why don't you send her over one, too
Next thing I remember
I was crawling 'round the room
She was dancing on the tables
I was blood shot, barkin' at the moon
Colorado Bulldog
This night has gone to my head
Colorado Bulldog
Throw a leash around my neck and Run like Hell
Swingin' from the rafters
Losing all control
Playing a game of little cat and mouse
I popped the question
I've been lonely much too long
Last call, drinks are on the house
Next thing I remember
Through the pandemonium
Feeling like a nightmare
That bites, right into my skin
Colorado Bulldog
This night has gone to my head
Colorado Bulldog
Throw a leash around my neck and Run like Hell
My sweet Lolita, A preying Maneater
Left me in the number six Motel
How was I to know
She'd strip me to the bone
And steal away my heart as well
Next thing I remember
Through the pandemonium
Feeling like a nightmare
That bite, right into my skin
Colorado Bulldog
This night has gone to my head
Colorado Bulldog
Throw a leash around my neck and run like Hell
Colorado Bulldog
This night has gone to my head
Colorado Bulldog
Throw a leash around my neck and run like Hell
Bottoms up, down the hatch
ItÂ´s time to start all over again
